# Any Kind of Car and Any Kind of Truck

![Any Kind of Car and Any Kind of Truck](screenshots/title.png)

An Ardubody ~game for my vehicle-obsessed toddler! Make randomly dimensioned vehicles and move them around.

| Buttons | Acttion |
| -- | -- |
| A | toggle title |
| B | randomize vehicle |
| Up | jump |
| Down | crouch |
| Left | move left |
| Right | move right |
| A + B + up | big car |
| A + B + down | baby car |

NOTE: This is my first Arduboy game and I don't write a lot of C++...
